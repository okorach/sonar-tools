**DISCLAIMER**: This software is community software.


# Requirements and Installation
- `sonar-migration` requires python 3.8 or higher
- Installation is based on [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
- Online installation.
  - Run: `python3 -m pip install sonar-migration` (or `python3 -m pip upgrade sonar-migration`)
  If install does not behave as expected you can try the **pip** `--force-reinstall` option (see **pip** documentation)
- `sonar-migration` is also available as a docker image. See [Using sonar-migration in Docker](#docker)


# Common command line parameters

All tools accept the following common parameters:
- `-h` : Displays a help and exits
- `-u` : URL of the SonarQube server. The default is environment variable `$SONAR_HOST_URL`
or `http://localhost:9000` by default if the environment variable is not set
- `-t` : Admin user token to invoke the SonarQube APIs, like `squ_83356c9b2db891d45da2a119a29cdc4d03fe654e`.
The default is environment variable `$SONAR_TOKEN`.
Using login/password is not possible.
The user corresponding to the token must have sufficiently elevated permissions to achieve the tool tasks
- `-f`: Define the output file, if not specified, `migration.<SERVER_ID>.json` is generated
- `-o` : Organization, for SonarCloud - Ignored if running against a SonarQube instance
- `-v` : Logging verbosity level (`WARN`, `ÌNFO` or `DEBUG`). The default is `INFO`.
`ERROR` and above is always active.
- `-c` or `--clientCert` : Allows to specify an optional client certificate file (as .pem file)
- `--httpTimeout` : Sets the timeout for HTTP(S) requests to the SonarQube platform
- `--skipIssues` : Skips the "expensive" issue count extract from the migration. This reduces by a factor of 2 to 3 the extract duration and the number of API calls
- `--skipVersionCheck` : `sonar-migration` occasionnally checks on pypi.org if there is a new version of **sonar-migration** available, and output a warning log if that is the case. You can skip this check with this option.
- `-l <logFile>` : Send logs to **<logFile>**, stdout by default

See common [error exit codes](#exit-codes) at the bottom of this page

## Required Permissions

To export data, `sonar-migration` needs elevated permissions

## Examples
```
export SONAR_HOST_URL=https://sonar.acme-corp.com
export SONAR_TOKEN=squ_83356c9b2db891d45da2a119a29cdc4d03fe654e

# Exports all platform migration data from https://sonar.acme-corp.com in default output file migration.<SERVER_ID>.json
sonar-migration

# Exports all platform migration data from https://sonar.acme-corp.com in file data.json
sonar-migration -f data.json


```

For more about what is exported and imported by `sonar-config` please see the [sonar-config complete documentation](https://github.com/okorach/sonar-tools/blob/master/doc/sonar-config.md)

# <a name="docker"></a>Using sonar-migration in Docker

`sonar-migration` is available as a docker image. Here is how to use the docker version:
```
docker pull olivierkorach/sonar-migration:latest

docker run --rm -w `pwd` -v `pwd`:`pwd` sonar-migration -t $SONAR_TOKEN -u https://sonar.acme.com 
# After the command the file migratiob.<SERVER_ID>.json should be in the local (pwd) directory

# Alternatively you can pass the SonarQube URL and token as environment variables
docker run --rm -w `pwd` -v `pwd`:`pwd` -e SONAR_TOKEN=<YOUR_SONAR_TOKEN> -e SONAR_HOST_URL=<YOUR_SONAR_URL> sonar-migration

# If you run sonar-migration on same machine as SonarQube, to help, the URL fragment http://localhost is automatically transformed in http://host.docker.internal, 
# For instance the 2 commands below have same outcome
docker run --rm -w `pwd` -v `pwd`:`pwd` sonar-migration -t $SONAR_TOKEN -u http://host.docker.internal:9000
docker run --rm -w `pwd` -v `pwd`:`pwd` sonar-migration -t $SONAR_TOKEN -u http://localhost:9000
```

# <a name="exit-codes"></a>Exit codes

When sonar-migration complete successfully they return exit code 0. En case of fatal error the following exit codes may be returned:
- Code 1: Authentication error (Incorrect token provided)
- Code 2: Authorization error (provided token has insufficient permissions)
- Code 3: Other general Sonar API HTTP error
- Code 4: No token provided
- Code 5: Non existing project key provided
- Code 6: -
- Code 7: Unsupported operation requested (because of SonarQube edition or configuration)
- Code 8: -
- Code 9: -
- Code 10: Incorrect command line arguments
- Code 11: Global analysis or project analysis token provided (user token needed for sonar-tools)
- Code 12: HTTP request time-out using the SonarQube API
- Code 13: -
- Code 14: Sonar connection error
- Code 15: Miscellaneous OS errors
