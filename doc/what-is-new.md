    Import of YAML is not yet available
  - Beta version of config import in SonarCloud
- `sonar-audit` a couple of new audit problems on permission templates (with no permissions, with no or wrong regexp)

  - Fixed portfolios import/export
  - Fixed permissions import (for projects, applications and portfolios)
  - Better compatibility with SonarCloud
  - Other misc bug fixes
- `sonar-audit`: Added verification that projects are analyzed with the right scanner (Maven, Gradle, .Net). This verification is not 100% reliable


# Version 3.2.2

- Fix regressions in `sonar-config -i`

# Version 3.2.1

- Patch release to fix all compatibility problems with
  - Lower editions: All editions (Community, Developer, Enterprise) have been tested
  - 9.9 LTS/LTA version: All editions (Community, Developer, Enterprise) in version 9.9 have been tested

# Version 3.2

- Refactoring on portfolios for hardening
- `sonar-findings-export` and `sonar-rules` now have a `--languages` option to filter findings/rules in a restrained list of languages
- `sonar-measures-export` can export measures for Applications and Portfolios. For this reason, a new column (col 2) has been added to the CSV output format which can be PROJECT, BRANCH, APPLICATION, APPLICATIONBRANCH or PORTFOLIO
- `sonar-findings-export`:
  - Ability export findings for Applications and Portfolios, Application and Project branches
  - Fixes in SARIF export format
  - Adjustments to new issues taxonomy
  - Added option to not export all Sonar findings custom properties in SARIF export for more compact output
  - Added finding author and language column in CSV export, in JSON and SARIF too
  - Updated SARIF format export to not export custom properties when already standard SARIF fields
  - Have a new field language for the issue language
- `sonar-config`:
  - Smart handling of properties that can be lists. If the list contains a comma, the property
  is exported as list, if no comma, as a more compact comma separated string
  - Settings that are the default are no longer exported unless `--exportDefaults` option is provided
  - Changed the key for default branch from `__default__` to `-DEFAULT_BRANCH-` to make sure that this cannot conflict with a real branch name (because git forbids branches starting by -)
  - Portfolio export format has been slightly changed for consistency


# Version 3.1

  - Major `sonar-finding-sync` hardening
    - Significant performance improvement through multithreading

## General
- All tools that connect to a SonarQube server can not specify a client certificate if needed
- Potentially long running tools displays in the logs the total execution time at end of execution
- Several optimizations (caching) have been implemented to reduce number of SonarQube API calls
- Multi-threading for `sonar-audit`, `sonar-findings-export` and `sonar-config --export` for important performance (speed) gains
- Several new `sonar-audit` audited items

## sonar-audit
- Tool is now multi-threaded, this can dramatically increase speed of audit on large platforms with a lot of projects (which is the object consuming most of the auditing time)
- Tool now uses live data for Sonar update center (instead of hardcoding versions) to determine what version are LTA (ex-LTS) and LATEST
- Tool now allows to audit a selection of project or portfolios (chosen by their key)
- Tool now gracefully fails when a non existing project key is specified
- Tool now allows to add a link to the concerned object in the audit report (makes it easy to navigate to the object to fix)
- New **audit**ed stuff
  - Audits the version of scanner used and raise a warning if too old
  - Audits for portfolios and application background tasks failures
  - Audits permission templates (with same rules as project permissions)
  - Audits for warnings in last project scan (on main branch)
  - Audits when proportion of JSON code in a project is too high (More than 50% of JSON LoC for projects bigger than 100K LoC total). The same check already existed for XML before
  - Audits for global webhook delivery failures
  - Audits when a project both have a `main` and a `master` branch. This is a sign of potential misconfiguration
- Fixes:
  - Fixes a crash when some projects have too many users with admin permissions
  - Fixes a duplicate warning when 2 projects has suspiciously similar keys (May be different branches of same project)

## sonar-config
- **export** is now multi-threaded, this can dramatically increase speed of export on large platforms with a lot of projects (which is the object consuming most of the auditing time)
- **export** now offers the option to export all object attributes, including thos that are useless for future import. Those attributes are prefixed by `_` (underscore)
- **import** now issues a warning when applying an unknown setting (typo in setting key?)
- Fixes:
  - Fix in **export** for permissions that could be incorrect in some cases
  - Fix in **export** of branch new code period definition export that was incorrect in some cases
  - Fix in **import** of project quality profiles that did not work when the quality profile had a spec in the name
  - Fix in **import** of applications: When the project main branch was used the application definition did not work
  - Fix v2.3 doc still stating that import was not available (it was already available in v2.3)

## sonar-findings-export
- Tool is now multi-threaded, this can dramatically increase speed of export on large platforms with a lot of projects and a lot of issues
- Tool gracefully fails when a non existing project key is specified

## sonar-findings-sync
- Fix regression. tool was broken in v2.3

# Version 2.3

## General changes
- Adjust logs to new SonarQube 9.5 token format
- `sonar-tools` now use a specific user agent for all SonarQube API invocations (to recognized `sonar-tools` activity the whole SonarQube HTTP Traffic)

## sonar-config
- **import** of previously exported configurations is now available
- **export** format has been slightly modified to be more compact:
  - Groups, subportfolios, Quality Profiles and Users SCM accounts export format has changed
  - Built-in Quality Profiles and Quality Gates are no longer exported
  - Default group membership to sonar-users group is ommited
- **export** added a few missing items
  - Project visibility
  - Project specific webhooks
  - Branches protected from purge when inactive
  - Project main branch
  - Projects and Applications tags
  - Rules with custom extended description or custom tags
  - Custom rules (rules instantiated from rule templates)
- **export**: A few optimizationson export format to avoid exporting useless or empty stuff (objects will all the default settings)
- Fixes:
  - Fixes on quality gates permissions export
  - Fix on export of portfolios definition based on tags (was erroneously exported as regexp)
  - Gracefully handle commas in object whose key or name can contain a comma
  - Export local users group membership
  - Export multiple DevOps platforms of each type if there is mor ethan one
  - Export fails on permission templates with no regexp

## sonar-audit
- Fixes
  - `sonar-audit --config` fails
