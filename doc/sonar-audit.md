# sonar-audit

Command line tool to audit a SonarQube instance and output warning logs whenever a suspicious or incorrect setting/situation is found.
The detail of what is audited is listed at the bottom of this page

## Requirements and Installation

`sonar-audit` is installed through the **sonar-tools** [general installation](../README.md#install)

:warning: **sonar-tools** 2.7 or higher is required for `sonar-audit` compatibility with SonarQube 10

## Common command line parameters

`sonar-audit` accepts all the **sonar-tools** [common parameters](../README.md#common-params)

## Usage

`sonar-audit [-u <url>] [-t <token>] [--what <auditSelection>] [--sif <SIF>] [-f <file>] [--format [json|csv]] [-h] [-v <debugLevel>]`

`--what` can be followed by a list of comma separated items to audit.
When `--what` is not specified, everything is audited

- `--what settings`: Audits global settings and general system data (system info in particular)
- `--what qp`: Audits quality profiles
- `--what qg`: Audits quality gates
- `--what projects`: Audits all projects. This can be a fairly long operation
- `--what users`: Audits users and their tokens
- `--what groups`: Audits groups
- `--what portfolios`: Audits portfolios
- `--what apps`: Audits applications
- `-f <file>`: Sends audit output to `<file>`, `stdout` is the default. The output format is deducted from
  the file extension (JSON or CSV), except if `--format` is specified
- `--sif <SystemInfoFile>`: Will audit the input SIF file, instead of connecting to a SonarQube platform.
  In that case:
  - URL and token are not needed
  - Much less is audited (because SIF does not provide as much information as a live platform)
- `--format [json|csv]`: Generates output in JSON or CSV format (CSV is the default)
- `--csvSeparator <separator>`: Allows to select the separator character for CSV, `,` is the default
- `--threads <nbThreads>`: Allows to define number of threads for projects auditing (default 1). More threads
  will stress SonarQube APIs more but will be much faster on large platforms with many projects
- `-h`: Displays help and exits
- `-u`, `-t`, `-h`, `-v`: See **sonar-tools** [common parameters](../README.md#common-params)

## Required Permissions

To be able to audit everything, the token provided to `sonar-audit` should have the global `Administer System` permission and `Browse`and `Administer` permission on all projects.

## Configuration file

`sonar-audit` can be configured with a configuration file to select what to audit and some different
other audit parameters.
You can create a default config file in the home directory by running `sonar-audit --config`

See [sonar-audit configuration](https://github.com/okorach/sonar-tools/blob/master/doc/audit-settings.md) for the details of parameters

## Example
```
export SONAR_HOST_URL=https://sonar.acme-corp.com
export SONAR_TOKEN=squ_83356c9b2db891d45da2a119a29cdc4d03fe654e

# Audits everything, send results to stdout in CSV format
sonar-audit

# Audits everything, send results to fullAudit.json in JSON format
sonar-audit -f fullAudit.json

# Audits global settings, quality profiles and quality gates
sonar-audit --what settings,qg,qp

# Audits SIF, send results to stdout in CSV format
sonar-audit --sif systemInfoFile.json

# Audits projects, send results to projectsAudit.csv in CSV format with ; as separator
sonar-audit --what projects -f projectsAudit.csv --csvSeparator ';'
```
