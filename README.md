# sonar-tools
Command line tools to help in SonarQube administration tasks. Available as a **pypi.org** package or a **docker** image.

`sonar-tools` is compatible with SonarQube versions 9.9.x, LTA (2025.1.x as of June 2025), latest 2025.x (2025.3.x as of June 2025). It may work with older 9.x versions or intermediate 10.x versions but this is not guaranteed.

:information_source: Although they are likely to work with many versions, the offered tools are **only tested against SonarQube Server LTA (Long Term Active, 2025.1.x as of Oct 2025), LATEST (2025.5.x as of Oct 2025), Community Build (25.9.x as of Oct 2025) and 9.9.9 versions**

:warning: **sonar-tools** 2.7 or higher is required for compatibility with SonarQube Server 10

# What's New - Release notes
- [What's new](https://github.com/okorach/sonar-tools/blob/master/doc/what-is-new.md)
- [Release notes](https://github.com/okorach/sonar-tools/releases)

# Requirements and Installation
- `sonar-tools` requires python 3.9 or higher
- Installation is based on [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

## Online installation.
  - Run: `python3 -m pip install sonar-tools` (or `python3 -m pip upgrade sonar-tools`)
  If install does not behave as expected you can try the **pip** `--force-reinstall` option (see **pip** documentation)

## Offline installation: If you have no access to the internet on the install machine, you can:
  - Download the `.whl` file from https://pypi.org/project/sonar-tools or attached to the release at https://github.com/okorach/sonar-tools/releases. The file should be something like. **sonar_tools-\<VERSION\>-py3-none-any.whl**
  - Copy the downloaded file on the install machine
  - On the install machine, run `python3 -m pip install sonar_tools-<VERSION>-py3-none-any.whl`
  - Note: The package is dependent upon `argparse`, `datetime`, `python-dateutil`, `requests` and `jprops` python packages that are automatically installed when installing `sonar-tools`

## Docker installation

  - `sonar-tools` is now also available as a docker image.
  - Run: `docker pull olivierkorach/sonar-tools:latest` to install

 Then see [Using sonar-tools in Docker](https://github.com/okorach/sonar-tools/blob/master/doc/sonar-loc.md) for details

# Common command line parameters

All tools accept the following common parameters:
- `-h` : Displays a help and exits
- `-u` : URL of the SonarQube Server or Cloud. The default is environment variable `$SONAR_HOST_URL`
or `http://localhost:9000` by default if the environment variable is not set
- `-t` : User token to invoke the Server or Cloud APIs, like `squ_83356c9b2db891d45da2a119a29cdc4d03fe654e`.
The default is environment variable `$SONAR_TOKEN`.
Using login/password is not possible.
The user corresponding to the token must have enough permissions to achieve the tool tasks
- `-o` : Organization, for SonarQube Cloud - Ignored if running against a SonarQube Server
- `-v` : Logging verbosity level (`WARN`, `ÃŒNFO` or `DEBUG`). The default is `INFO`.
`ERROR` and above is always active.
- `-c` or `--clientCert` : Allows to specify an optional client certificate file (as .pem file)
- `--httpTimeout` : Sets the timeout for HTTP(S) requests to the SonarQube Server or Cloud platform, in seconds
- `--skipVersionCheck` : Starting with **sonar-tools** 2.11, by default all sonar tools occasionnally check on pypi.org if there is a new version of **sonar-tools** available, and output a warning log if that is the case. You can skip this check with this option.
- `-l <logFile>` : Send logs to **<logFile>**, stdout by default
- `--threads <nbThreads>`: Allows to define number of threads for projects auditing (default 1). More threads
  will stress SonarQube APIs more but will be much faster on large platforms with many projects
